# Pixelated
This repository is the solution for CTF named Pixelated under Cryptography category of picoCTF.
This CTF is based on Visual Cryptography

### Dependencies
Python Library : OpenCV, Numpy

### Approach
Randomly played with pixels of images and came to a solution that we have to flip the pixels of one of 
the image and add both of them to find the flag(Detailed solution is written in the code itself)
